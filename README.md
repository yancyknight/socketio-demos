# socketio-demos
A repo for playing with Socket.io. Examples taken from Pluralsight course found <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/socket-io-building-real-time-applications/table-of-contents">here</a>.

This repo has multiple projects. Each top level directory is a separate project.

I didn't finish the btcApp project because all that was left was outputting to the DOM, which isn't really part of Socket.io.
